- Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Organize code in domain-driven structure under `src/modules/` (e.g., movieList, movieDetail)
- Extract reusable utilities to `src/core/utils/` directory
- Place shared components in `src/core/components/` following atomic design
- Store Redux slices and sagas in `src/core/store/`
- Configure services and API clients in `src/core/services/`

- **Keep It Manageable**: Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps- **Request Small Steps**: Encourage the AI to break tasks into smaller, manageable changes, especially for refactoring processes.

- **Iterative Approach**: Encourage incremental changes for easier review and testing

- **Request Small Steps**: Split refactoring into focused, testable changes### 5. **Error Identification & Suggestions**

### 5. **Error Identification & Solutions**- **Highlight Code Smells**: Identify common code smells and request actionable solutions:

- **Mysterious Names**: Request descriptive naming suggestions.

- **Highlight Code Smells**: Identify and suggest fixes for: - **Duplicate Code**: Seek refactoring suggestions for shared functions.

  - **Mysterious Names**: Propose descriptive naming improvements - **Long Functions**: Propose decomposition into smaller, single-responsibility functions.

  - **Duplicate Code**: Recommend extraction into shared utilities - Ensure aggressive suggestions on minimizing large classes and nested structures.
